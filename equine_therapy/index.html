            <h3>What is Equine Therapy?</h3>
            <p>Equine therapy is a method of psychotherapy where a licensed clinician/equine therapist (i.e., counselor, therapist, or social worker trained in equine therapy) incorporates the use of horses in sessions. They guide clients through various activities with the horses to help address and overcome life challenges. Clinicians often work alongside an equine specialist to provide a safe and beneficial environment for both clients and horses in this experiential form of therapy. Equine therapy offers many unique benefits.</p>
