      <p><b>What is Equine Therapy?</b></p>
      <p>Equine therapy is a method of psychotherapy where a licensed clinician/equine therapist (i.e., counselor, therapist, or social worker trained in equine therapy) incorporates the use of horses in sessions. They guide clients through various activities with the horses to help address and overcome life challenges. Clinicians often work alongside an equine specialist to provide a safe and beneficial environment for both clients and horses in this experiential form of therapy. Equine therapy offers many unique benefits. [Button: Learn more]</p>

      <p><b>Who May Benefit from Equine Therapy?</b></p>
      <p>Equine therapy is best for individuals ages 10 and older who are seeking assistance in overcoming life challenges. Group therapy sessions can also be valuable for providing immediate feedback on dynamics within the group. Some circumstances may include [Unordered List]: Understanding and navigating family relationships, individuals seeking to overcome life challenges, helping youth in similar circumstances learn about themselves and others, team building for organizations, and more. No previous horse experience is needed. [Button: Find a Therapist]</p>

      <h1><b>Why Use Horses in Therapy?</b></h1>
      <p><em>Horses provide unique benefits in therapy. Click on the images below to learn more about three of these benefits.</em></p>
      <p><b><em>The Gift of Attunement</em></b></p>
      <p>Horses are naturally prey animals and live in herds for protection against predators. As such, they are keenly aware of nonverbal emotions and micro changes within the herd, adjusting accordingly. Their sensitivity and attunement to emotions and behaviors makes them great for psychotherapy because they tune in to clients’ emotions and micro behaviors just as they do with their other herd members. This provides immediate feedback and can help clients better “see” and understand the turmoil within that may be difficult recognize and express. Horses’ attunement helps bring to light what may be otherwise difficult to identify and express, helping the client and clinician recognize root struggles, allowing them to establish a clear path forward.</p>
      <p><b><em>The Gift of Externalization</em></b></p>
      <p>Every client comes to therapy with a story–told, untold, or a bit of both. Humans experience many life challenges, including [Unordered List]: Addiction, unhealthy habits, relationship tension with family and/or friends, anxiety, depression, grief, overwhelm, physical/emotional trauma, and more. When a client enters the space with a herd, the horses tune in to clients’ emotions and micro behaviors just as they do with their other herd members. This allows clients to externalize (or nonverbally convey) their experience, using the horses’ behaviors to help tell their story. Externalizing allows the client to share their story, avoid retraumatization (reliving a traumatic experience), and more easily process the experiences and emotions. This can be especially helpful when a client struggles to see and understand what they are feeling and experiencing within.</p>
      <p><b><em>The Gift of Teaching</em></b></p>
      <p>A horse’s gifts of attunement and externalization lead to a third gift–the gift of teaching. Just like us, horses have a variety of roles and personalities and we can learn different things from different horses. In these sessions, as horses pick up on and respond to our emotions, we can recognize what works well and what doesn’t in our lives. Horses are big and powerful. Interacting with them helps us reflect on relationships and challenges that feel bigger than us and how we can approach these difficulties. Some of the many lessons that horses can help us learn include [Unordered List]: Healthy boundaries, healthy relationships/interactions, healthy habits, self-awareness, self-esteem, self-compassion, empathy, confidence, and much more. Exploring different ways of approaching and interacting with horses provides immediate feedback, helping us apply these learning experiences to life challenges.</p>

      <p>Ready to get started? If you or someone you know would like to participate in Equine Therapy, there are a number of ways to explore options near you. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:</p>
      <ul>  <!-- I recognize this won't be formatted correctly here. I'll be sure that if I end up using a list that it's formatted correctly on my site -->
        <li>Performing a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PsychologyToday.com</a> search for “Equine Therapist”</li>
        <li>Performing a <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a> search for “Equine Therapist near [City, State]”</li>
        <li>Searching on <a href="https://my.eagala.org/programs;d=None" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EAGALA's website</a> (Equine-Assisted Growth and Learning)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Please note: If an individual has an extreme fear of horses or has limitations that may prevent them from safely interacting with horses, equine therapy may not be the best option. It’s recommended to speak with a mental health professional (traditional or equine therapist).</em></p>

        The three images below "The Gift of..." will be interactive. When clicking on one of the images, my plan is to have the content about that image drop down below it, as shown in the wireframe where the title will either be "Attunement", "Externalization", or "Teaching" based on the image clicked. Then the content about that will appear below as is indicated in the wireframe.
