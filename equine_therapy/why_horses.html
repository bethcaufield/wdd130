                    <p>Horses are naturally prey animals and live in herds for protection against predators. As such, they are keenly aware of nonverbal emotions and micro changes within the herd, adjusting accordingly. Their sensitivity and attunement to emotions and behaviors makes them great for psychotherapy because they tune in to clients’ emotions and micro behaviors just as they do with their other herd members. This provides immediate feedback and can help clients better “see” and understand the turmoil within that may be difficult recognize and express. Horses’ attunement helps bring to light what may be otherwise difficult to identify and express, helping the client and clinician recognize root struggles, allowing them to establish a clear path forward.</p>

                    <h3>Externalization</h3>
                    <img class="externalize_img" src="images/externalization.jpg" alt="Person Resting Head Against Horse">
                    <p>A horse’s gifts of attunement and externalization lead to a third gift–the gift of teaching. Just like us, horses have a variety of roles and personalities and we can learn different things from different horses. In these sessions, as horses pick up on and respond to our emotions, we can recognize what works well and what doesn’t in our lives. Horses are big and powerful. Interacting with them helps us reflect on relationships and challenges that feel bigger than us and how we can approach these difficulties. Some of the many lessons that horses can help us learn include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healthy boundaries</li>
                            <li>Healthy relationships/interactions</li>
                            <li>Healthy habits</li>
                            <li>Self-awareness</li>
                            <li>Positive self-esteem</li>
                            <li>Self-compassion</li>
                            <li>Empathy</li>
                            <li>Confidence</li>
                            <li>and much more</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>When a client enters the space with a herd, the horses tune in to clients’ emotions and micro behaviors just as they do with their other herd members. This allows clients to externalize (or nonverbally convey) their experience, using the horses’ behaviors to help tell their story. Externalizing allows the client to share their story, avoid retraumatization (reliving a traumatic experience), and more easily process the experiences and emotions. This can be especially helpful when a client struggles to see and understand what they are feeling and experiencing within.</p>

                    <p>Every client comes to therapy with a story–told, untold, or a bit of both. Humans experience many life challenges, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Addiction</li>
                            <li>Unhealthy habits</li>
                            <li>Relationship tension with family and/or friends</li>
                            <li>Anxiety</li>
                            <li>Depression</li>
                            <li>Grief</li>
                            <li>Overwhelm</li>
                            <li>Physical/emotional trauma</li>
                            <li>and more</li>
